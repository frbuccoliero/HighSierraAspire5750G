# Todo
1) I recommend you to upgrade your BIOS to a fixed version that i found on YT (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mNsPxnGaH0) by witch you're now able to boot in UEFI mode. That's great!

2) You have to change the SERIAL NUMBER into clover plist settings, with another generated by clover configurator, or maybe with this script (https://gist.github.com/graphis/688e2caa200d2b4182f7b9cc20a14731), according with the SMBIOS
